## Roblox Scripts
A compilation of my roblox scripts. I don't feel like using gist so I'm uploading all stand-alone or small grouped scripts here.

### Scripts
- [TP Player Script](https://github.com/fluffyydev/roblox-scripts/blob/main/tpPlayerScript.luau) - Simple script that teleports the player to the location provided when a brick is touched.
- [Tool Giver Script](https://github.com/fluffyydev/roblox-scripts/blob/main/toolGivierScript.luau) - Intermediate script that can be put into tools so that if the handle is touched then it will give a copy of the tool.
- [Disable Team Wall Collision](https://github.com/fluffyydev/roblox-scripts/blob/main/allowTeamToCollide.luau) - Intermediate script that disables the ability of colliding with any of the walls inside of a folder for every player on a team.
